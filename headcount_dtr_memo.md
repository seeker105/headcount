**Group Member Names:** Matt Pindell, Christopher Soden

**What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?**
**Chris** Hopes to get 4's and 3's - as well as develop his skills with File Input/Output as well as Enumerables.
**Matt** Also hopes to improve his understanding of File Input/Output and Enums - and have a strong emphasis on TDD.

**When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?**
**Chris** - for the project, Chris will be at Turing (approximately) between 8am and 8:30pm during the week, with flexible weekends. Chris also has Appointments at 5pm on both Wednesdays.
**Matt** - for the project, Matt will be at Turing between 8:30am and 10:30pm during the week, with flexible weekends.
We are planning on working together, at Turing, from 4:00pm to 8:30pm on most days (the first Monday and both Wednesdays excluded). On Weekends, we will both meet at Turing at 8:30am and work until approximately 8-9pm, playing the ending time by ear. On the first Monday and both Wednesdays - we will use Screenhero to work together from approximately 7:00pm to 8:30pm.

**How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?**
Mostly face-to-face, other than that, we can use Screenhero, Slack, and Waffle - we will also exchange cell numbers.

**What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?**
*Strengths*
**Christopher:** general programming / ruby syntax, IDE navigation, concepts of object-oriented programming.
**Matt:** putting in the hours and testing (but not always through pure TDD).

*Improvements*
**Christopher:** breaking things down into their logical components, and appropriately dividing responsibilities between methods, classes, etc. - as well as building on existing strengths. Stronger working knowledge of relevant Ruby tools.
**Matt:** Would also like a strong working knowledge of relevant Ruby tools - as well as to build up his ability to logically break down his code and keep things DRY.

**Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?**
Mostly, we'll work together on the entirety of the project - neither of us have any specific features we are averse to or attracted to.

**What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?**
The project will be on Christopher's GitHub - Matt will be added as a collaborator, and we'll communicate via Git Merge Requests, Waffle, Slack, and in-person conversations.

**What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?**
That they'll communicate their issues and work with their partner to resolve them.

**How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?**
All feedback should be specific, actionable, and kind - and, ideally, should be delivered in writing - for future reference.

**Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?** Not at this time.
